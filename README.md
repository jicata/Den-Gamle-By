Den Gamle By's Witch Hunt event. My very first project as a multimedia designer. I've used HTML and CSS. I have focused extensively on
providing textual content and relevant design. It's clear that I'm making my first steps into the field, making a lot
of repetitions and using long and heavy tags and lines. It is hard to maintain but there was no need for maintenance
for this specific project.I learned a lot about the entire proccess of creating a webpage, like using proper tags,
explaining my code and trying to avoid repetition. I also gained understanding of the basic workings of HTML and CSS.
